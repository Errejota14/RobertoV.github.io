I've been a Jetbrains Mono font user for the longest time. I used it in my editor, terminal and every other place that required a mono font.

It's a great font and the squary looks is kinda nice. The font is developed by an IDE developing company after all.

Though I recently found a new font that looks even better in my eyes and I've been replacing Jetbrains Mono with it everywhere. The font is **Maple mono** and there is no org behind it as far as I know.
