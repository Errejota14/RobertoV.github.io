I've been using Gnome with Fedora after they(Gnome 49) have improved the [Fractional Scaling experience](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/4503).

I just wanted to get more involved with Gnome and Linux in general since I've always been a consumer and I thought it would be even good if I could contribute and maybe boast about it in an interview 😜.

I started researching more about GTK, Gnome and all those related things. Even though docs are scattered everywhere, there is good content and I even made a GTK app named [Brief](https://github.com/shonebinu/brief) using Python, its a GUI client for [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr). Its on [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.shonebinu.Brief) if you wanna check it out.

Well ignore those, the thing I wanted to boast about is that I contributed to Gnome 😗! Specifically Gnome Files (Nautilus). It's a small PR and I didn't even think it would get accepted.

You can check out the issue and PR in the following given links.
